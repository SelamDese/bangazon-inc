# Not Hello, World

## Getting Started Guide

Please read and complete the steps in the official [Get Started with C# and Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/with-visual-studio-code) guide.

## Setup

We're going to get your first C# console application setup and running so that we can review some basics of the language.

Create a directory to hold the application.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/workspace/csharp/intro && cd $_
```

Create a new console application with the `dotnet` command line utility.

```sh
dotnet new console
```

This will create two files in the directory

1. `intro.csproj` - This file holds all the packages that you application will be using. It's the `package.json` for C#.
1. `Program.cs` - This is the file that holds your logic. Think of it as your `main.js`. It's where the logic of your application starts.

Copy this code into your Program.cs, replacing everything there.

```cs
using System;

namespace bangazoncli
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Welcome to Bangazon!");
        }
    }
}

```

> â˜ž Unike JavaScript, C# is a compiled language, meaning that you need a compiler to read the source code, parse all the logic, and then construct a new executable file.

Next, you compile the program.

```sh
dotnet build
```

Now that you have verified that the program will compile without errors, you can execute it.

```sh
dotnet run
```

You should see `Welcome to Bangazon!` print out in your terminal.

## Strongly Typed Variable in C#

Now replace your source code with the following.

```cs
using System;

namespace bangazon
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // DateTime is the type of the purchaseData variable.
            DateTime purchaseDate=DateTime.Now;

            /*
                string is the type of the lastName variable. It
                tells the compiler that the lastName variable can
                ONLY hold a string value.
            */
            string lastName="Smith";

            /*
                C# now supports implicitly typing of a variable. The
                type of the variable will be determined, by the
                compiler, at compile time.
            */
            var firstName="Bill";

            /*
                String interpolation in C# is similar to string interpolation in JavaScript,
                but there is a different syntax.

                An equivalent statement in JavaScript would be:
                console.log(`${firstName} ${lastName} purchased on ${purchaseDate}`);
            */
            Console.WriteLine($"{firstName} {lastName} purchased on {purchaseDate}");
        }
    }
}
```

# C# Collections and Loops

The C# language has many ways to store a collection of items. You'll quickly see that C# is much more verbose when you write your source code, because the developer needs to provide all of the instructions to the compiler, unlike JavaScript or other dynamically typed languages.

We'll look at a simple type of collection first - list of strings. Add the following code to your `Main` method.

```cs
/*
    Not only do you have to say what type the variable is, you also
    have to instantiate that exact same type of object on assignment.
    This may seem redundant, but it's part of the C# language compiler's
    type checking constraints.
*/
List<string> products = new List<string>() {
    "Motorcycle",
    "Sofa",
    "Sandals",
    "Omega Watch",
    "iPhone"
};

/*
    A foreach loop is used to iterate over a collection.

    The code below is roughly equivalent to the following JavaScript:
    products.forEach(product => {
        console.log(product);
    });
*/
foreach (string product in products) {
    Console.WriteLine(product);
}

/*
    Like JavaScript, C# has a for() loop

    This code is equivalent to the foreach loop above.
*/
for (int i=0; i<products.Count; i++) {
    Console.WriteLine(products[i]);
}
```

# C# Conditions

Luckily, the `if-then` syntax works exactly like it did in JavaScript. 
Let's display a different message based on on the length of a product.

```cs
foreach (string product in products) {
    if (product.Length < 5) {
        Console.WriteLine($"{product} has a short name");
    } else if (product.Length < 10) {
        Console.WriteLine($"{product} has a medium-sized name");
    } else {
        Console.WriteLine($"{product} has a long name");
    }
}
```
